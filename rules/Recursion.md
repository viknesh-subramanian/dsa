### Rules

* Identify the best case
* Identify the recursive case
* Get closer and closer and finally return when needed - usually we have 2 returns

### Scenarios

* Consider using recursion while using tree or converting something into a tree
* Divide a problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem
* Each instance of the subproblem is identical in nature
* The solutions of each subproblem can be combined to solve the problem at hand
