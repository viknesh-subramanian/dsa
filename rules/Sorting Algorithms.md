### Rules

#### Insertion Sort
* Should be used only if your input is small or if items are mostly sorted

#### Merge Sort
* Should be used only if you worry about worst case scenarios with respect to time complexity. Has worse space complexity than Quick Sort

#### Quick Sort
* Should be used only if you don't worry about worst case scenarios with respect to time complexity. Has better space complexity than Merge Sort
* Also advisable only if you can pick the pivot property correctly

#### Heap Sort
* Should be used only if you worry about worst case scenarios with respect to both time and space complexities.
* In reality, Heap Sort is a little bit slower than Quick Sort
