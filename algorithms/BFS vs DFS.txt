Question -
If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
Answer - 
BFS (DFS is acceptable too but it takes a long time in such scenarios - uses recursion)

Question -
If the tree is very wide:
Answer -
DFS (BFS is acceptable too but it takes a lot of memory as it needs to keep track of the nodes at the current level)

Question -
If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:

DFS
