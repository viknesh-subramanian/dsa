O(2 ^ N). Grows very rapidly. Often requires memoization to avoid repeated computations and reduce complexity. Could be:
* Combinational problems, backtracking - like subsets
* Often involves recursion and is harder to analyze time complexity at first sight
* Typically for n â‰¤ 20
* A recursive fibonacci is O(2 ^ N)
