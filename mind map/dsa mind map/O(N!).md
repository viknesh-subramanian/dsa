Grows insanely rapidly. Only solvable by computers for small values of N. Often requires memoization to avoid repeated computations and reduce complexity. Could be:
* Combinatorial problems, backtracking - like permutations
* Often involves recursion and is harder to analyze time complexity at first sight
* Typically for n â‰¤ 12
