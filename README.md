# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Data Structures

### Arrays
#### When to use:
* During lookups
* During push/pop
* Ordered
#### When not to use:
* During inserts
* During deletes
* Fixed size arrays

### Hash Tables
#### When to use:
* During lookups - only if hash collision is adjusted for
* Fast inserts
* Flexible keys

#### When not to use:
* Ordering - because Hash tables are unordered by default
* Key iteration - because key iteration is very slow
