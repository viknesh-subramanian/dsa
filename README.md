# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Data Structures

### Arrays
#### Pros:
* During lookups
* During push/pop
* Ordered
#### Cons:
* During inserts
* During deletes
* Fixed size arrays

### Hash Tables
#### Pros:
* During lookups - only if hash collision is adjusted for
* Fast inserts
* Flexible keys

#### Cons:
* Ordering - because Hash tables are unordered by default
* Key iteration - because key iteration is very slow

### Linked Lists
#### Pros:
* Fast inserts
* Fast deletes
* Ordered
* Flexible size

#### Cons:
* Slow lookups
* Consumes more memory

### Stacks and Queues
#### Pros:
* Fast operations
* Fast peek
* Ordered

#### Cons:
* Slow lookups

### Binary Search Trees
#### Pros:
* Better than O(n)
* Flexible size
* Ordered

#### Cons:
* No O(1) operations

### Binary Heaps
#### Pros:
* Better than O(n)
* Priority
* Flexible size
* Fast insert

#### Cons:
* Slow lookups
